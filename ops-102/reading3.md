# Questions?

Understanding BIOS is important as it is the first step in determining why your computer is not turning on and operating to the correct parameters. Since BIOS and CMOS work together, you can diagnose the problem easily as to why there may be a problem in the bootup process. 


BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. It loads the operating system when turned on. 

**Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?**

We had a diesel engine that we had to to ensure the lineup was correct before starting up the engine. It's like we are "booting" up the engine. We check all parameters to ensure that we when start the engine, it would start. These line ups were done in a certain order as well just how BIOS can be priototize to have a bootup sequence. 

**What is the “Power On Self Test”?**
When turning on a computer, BIOS will do a self-check to see if main hardware like the CPU, RAM, storage drives, and graphics card are functioning. 

**What is the CMOS?**

CMOS stands for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. 

**What is the CMOS battery?**

The CMOS battery is the battery power semiconductor on the motherboard that has stored information needed during the booting process. 

## Notes

BIOS (Basic Input Output System) loads the operating system when turned on

BIOS is software that is placed on ROM chip on the motherboard

Upon start up (booting), the operating system is loaded onto the main RAM. Booting is complete when OS is fully loaded onto main RAM

Power on Self Test is when BIOS check to see if system hardware are functioniong properly

BIOS can boot certain devices in OS first. 

BIOS can set parameters of hardware for efficient performance

BIOS is a low-level system control. Once booting is complete, OS has full control.  

CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) used to produce IC chips

CMOS in computer are used to store critical data in the OS during booting process

If CMOS fails, flash error will occur during bootup. 

1. Date and time will be wrong
2. BIOS fails to boot system
3. Hardware failure


**What happens when we turn on computer?**

The power supply sends electricity to the components of the computer, such as the motherboard, hard drive, and fans.

The BIOS (basic input/output system) initializes and performs a power-on self-test (POST), which checks the basic hardware components to ensure they are working properly. If any issues are detected, error messages may be displayed.

The operating system (OS), such as Windows or macOS, is loaded from the hard drive or another storage device into the computer’s RAM (random access memory).

The OS then initializes its own components and drivers and presents the login screen or desktop environment to the user.
