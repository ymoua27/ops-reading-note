We're all probably used to using a mouse and click on icons, but this reading helps us understand the very basics of the text interface for Linux. We have to understand what we are doing and why it responds the way it does when we input a command. 


# Questions?

**Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?**

Shell is a text base interface that a user can input commands to do what it wants. Terminal (Linux, MACOS) and command prompt (Windows) are the programs use to view the shell. The CLI is the command-line interface where the user will input commands.

**What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?**

cd- change directories

ls-list file's contents

mv-rename/move files


**What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?**

Relative paths involves the location you will end up at in your current working directory. Absolute is the root directory. 

 ~  Starts from home directory
 
 /  Starts from root directory

**Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.**

## Notes

Unix was one of the first operating systems that utilizes terminals.

There were no mouse and graphical user interface, so everything was done by text

Text is still used today due to its efficiency
