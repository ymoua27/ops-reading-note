Windows tend to have more 3rd party security software where macOS has built in security. Linux is open source and has a community for better control. It depends on how comfotable the user is and what they want to rely on. For more collaboration, they would go with Linux. If they don't want much involvement, then macOS would work for them. For Windows, they may want to be able to control it themselves.
