Understanding troubleshooting will make us better problem solvers. Using these methods will allow us to spend less time on a problem and more time fixing them.

**Questions?**

**What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?**

Tackle them all individually and go through the troubleshooting process

**What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?**

Make a plan of action with the most minimum impact especially if it affects production*

**What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?**

Anyone can search it and use it to solve the same problems in the future

**Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?**

The iPhone is pretty popular amongst the elders in my community. There is a language barrier because there is no word in our language like "app". The most common problem I see is not knowing how to download an app Like YouTube. They usually come to us with a problem and I would follow with questions. I ask them what is wrong and what they want to do. Once I tell them I'll have to download the app to their phone, it'll take up space and show them their storage space. I explain it would also take a few minutes to download and maybe set up your account. After that is done, they know what to do and understand how the app store works, most of the time.

# Notes

First step is to understand the problem first

Many things could cause the same problem

Ask users some questions

Has anything changed in the environment

Approach multiple problems individually

Start with the obvious, consider everything, and make a list of all things possible

Test theory. Try new theory if original didn't fix it. Call experts if needed.

Make many plans on how to resolve issue depending on impact

Fix during change window and confirm with customer to test fix

Document and consider database
