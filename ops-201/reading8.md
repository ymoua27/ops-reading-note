I would explain this to a chef like they are the computer. The chef has a cookbook with all kinds of recipes, just like the registry has all kinds of settings. If the chef wants to make changes to those recipes, it can change the outcome of the dish. I would explain the same thing happens when you change a setting in the registry. It tweaks it and it has different outcomes.
