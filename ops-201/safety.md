**What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**

Shared belief by team members that they are safe for taking risk, no one will be embarass or punish for speaking, having mutual respect for each other

**Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**

Working as a team can be difficult with different personalities, but we all understood our assignment. There was this unwritten rule of taking care of each other and making sure our personal lives were good. We always knew someone wasn't feeling themselves, because we saw each other everyday. Our leaders would always allow us to voice our opinions and sometimes the junior guy had the best idea.  

**What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**

It is great for their company  because they work well together no matter how smart or dumb they are. There is less stress since everyone is comfortable with each other and they have that trust. It makes them more cohesive which means they are more willing to help each other with no fear.
