**4. Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.**

Active Directory is like your "Contacts" app in your iPhone. You have your contacts name, phone number, addresses, and other notes in it. Active Directory is the same thing where it stores computer information. You can make updates to a contacts information like a new phone number, where Active Directory can do updates as well. You can group computers together to apply certain rules to them just how you can group your contacts into who they are, so you can send them all a text message instead of indivually selecting them.
