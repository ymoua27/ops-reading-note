# Questions?

**1. What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?**

Security monitoring, incident response, and log management

**2. Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.**

A SIEM solution allows you to see all activity on your network. Since SIEM collects and organizes all data from within a network, SOC can use this to detect and respond to internal and external attacks, simplify threat management, and gain organization-wide visibility and security intelligence

**3. How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.**

They both use a hierarchical approach to dealing with a problem. Based on the skills and experience of the team, they are put in the appropriate response level and if they can't solve it, it moves up a level.
