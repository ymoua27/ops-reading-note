**1. List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?**

A firewall keeps out malicious attacks where IDS detects and informs the user of suspicious activity. 

**2. Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?**

If cost is a factor, you can go with NIDS since it doesn't cost as much as HIDS. It is also easier to to set up and doesn't use much resource. NIDS is used to monitor your network if that is your main concern. 

**3. Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?**

Thy do not process encrypted packets, requires experience engineer to set up, and requires continous updates to keep up with threats.
