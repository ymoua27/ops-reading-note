# Questions?


1. **Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.**


    I would explain it as a ladder. When a customer goes up the ladder, AWS will take more on Non-Strategic Activities allowing the customers to focus on their business only.


2. **What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?**


    Control plane- Responsible for exposing the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and lifecycle containers.


    Data plane- Responsible for providing capacity (as in CPU/Memory/Network/Storage) so that those containers can actually run and connect to a network


3. **Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?**


    AWS Lambda is in the function abstraction. It is special because it is event-driven model. You don't a full blown instance to run your code and have AWS figure it out.
