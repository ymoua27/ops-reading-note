# Questions?

**1. Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.**

Lets say you're going away for awhile and want to protect your home from burgalry. You are going to identify potential access points like doors and windows. How can you set it up to make it harder for someone to get in? You may get security cameras or alarm your home. Upgrade any locks and place valuables in a safe. 

**2. What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?**

* What are we working on?
* What can go wrong?
* What are we going to do about it?
* Did we do a good job?

**3. You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?**

The big benefit is that it will improve our security by being able to identify potential risks in the early stages. If we build a strong foundation for security, it will only improve as time goes on.
