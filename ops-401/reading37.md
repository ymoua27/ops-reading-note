# Questions?

**1. What are the three common stages of the Penetration Testing process and what tasks are performed at each one?**

* Explore – The tester attempts to learn about the system being tested. This includes trying to determine what software is in use, what endpoints exist, what patches are installed, etc. It also includes searching the site for hidden content, known vulnerabilities, and other indications of weakness.

* Attack – The tester attempts to exploit the known or suspected vulnerabilities to prove they exist.

* Report – The tester reports back the results of their testing, including the vulnerabilities, how they exploited them and how difficult the exploits were, and the severity of the exploitation.

**Explain a “main-in-the-middle proxy” in non-technical terms.**

A middleman proxy is like a secret agent sitting between your computer and a website you're testing. It intercepts messages you send to the website and the responses you get back, allowing you to inspect or even modify them.

**What are the 2 spiders available for use in ZAP?**

* Traditional spider

* AJAX spider

**What situations are they best suited for?**
