# [What Are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 Hashes, and How Do I Check Them?](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/)

# Questions?

1. **You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?**

Confidentiality- Ensure only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data. Use encryprtion.

Integrity- Use hashing and version control

Availability- Have a diaster recovery plan and have back ups to the file server

2. **Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.**

Imagine theres a magic locker that changes the color of the key every time you add or remove items from it. If I give you a different color key from the last time, you know that something was changed. 

3. **How is hashing and encryption different?**

Encryption is reversible and hashing isn't.
