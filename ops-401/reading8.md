# Questions?

**1. How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution?**

Implementing a DLP solution helps secure data if it was lost or stolen. There are many places to store data and management of those data can get messy. Data breaches are also very common as well. Having those data taken is worth a lot of money. A DLP solution can track how the data is being handle and safe from attackers. 

**2. How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family?**

Personal Information Protection (PII)- These are your ids, socials security number, phone number, credit cards, or mmedical history that can identify you. DLP can identify these and monitor it closeley.

IP Protection- This protects your trade/state secrets that could harm the orginazation if lost or stolen.

Data Visibility- Allows an organizaiton to track movements of data. It's like having eyes on data all the time to see who is interacting with it.
