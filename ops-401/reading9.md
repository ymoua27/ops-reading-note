Certificate authority, private key, and public key

**2. How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.**

I have a lockbox and you have a key. Only the person that has they key can unlock it and see what is inside. There are many keys that can unlock it, but we have a locksmith specialize the key so I know it is you who is opening the lockbox and not anyone else. By doing this, this is how we know we both are safe and it goes to the right person.

Any CA can sign a certificate for any person or computer.
