# Case Study:China Spy Chip

Questions?

How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?


Hardware hack involves tampering with the physical components of the computer, easily going unnoticed until a laters notice. Software hack involves a program or tool to gain access to a computer. 


What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?


Interdiction consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from manufacturer to customer. The second way is seeding changes in the beginning. 


Explain how the hack worked.


Motherboards were planted a tiny coded chip that would communicate with anonymous computers and to prepare the device's operating system to accept the new code. It allowed access to anything the attackers wanted without being noticed. 


How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?


Since it was a hardware hack, it left a paper trail. They were able to trace it using invoices and investigates the plants manufacturing the chips.


## Notes

Amazon evaluates Elemental Technologies to expand live streaming

Amazon Web Services (AWS) hires third party to investigate Elemental security. 

They found that Super Micro Computer Inc are responsible for installing the servers.

Testers found tiny microchip on motherboard that wasn't not part of the orginal design

This is a huge problem as Elemental has servers in the DOD, CIA drone operations, and Navy warships

The chips allowed for the attackers to go into any network without being notice.

Chips inserted during manufacturing process.

Elemental was a prime target due to having DOD, NASA, Congress, and DOHS as customers.

Implanted chips did two things: telling the device to communicate with one of several anonymous computers elsewhere on the internet that were loaded with more complex code; and preparing the device’s operating system to accept this new code.

This allows attackers to have full access.

Source of the chips can be traced through supply logistics.

Investigators found People’s Liberation Army to be responsbile using various schemes to manilpulate plant managers.

Investigaors were able to hack anyomous comptuers to see which companies has been affected. About 30 companies were affected.
