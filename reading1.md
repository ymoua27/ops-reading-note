# Case Study:China Spy Chip

**Questions?**

**How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?**


Hardware hack involves tampering with the physical components of the computer, easily going unnoticed. Software hack involves a program or tool to gain access to a computer. 


**What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?**


Interdiction consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from manufacturer to customer. The second way is seeding changes in the beginning. 


**Explain how the hack worked.**


Motherboards were planted a tiny coded chip that would communicate with anonymous computers and to prepare the device's operating system to accept the new code. It allowed access to anything the attackers wanted without being noticed. 


**How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?**


Since it was a hardware hack, it left a paper trail. They were able to trace it using invoices and investigates the plants manufacturing the chips.


## Notes

Amazon evaluates Elemental Technologies to expand live streaming

Amazon Web Services (AWS) hires third party to investigate Elemental security

They found that Super Micro Computer Inc are responsible for installing the servers

Testers found tiny microchip on motherboard that wasn't not part of the original design

This is a huge problem as Elemental has servers in the DOD, CIA drone operations, and Navy warships

The chips allowed for the attackers to go into any network without being notice

Chips inserted during manufacturing process

Elemental was a prime target due to having DOD, NASA, Congress, and DOHS as customers

Implanted chips did two things: telling the device to communicate with one of several anonymous computers elsewhere on the internet that were loaded with more complex code; and preparing the device’s operating system to accept this new code

This allows attackers to have full access

Source of the chips can be traced through supply logistics

Investigators found People’s Liberation Army to be responsible using various schemes to manipulate plant managers

Investigators were able to hack anyomous computers to see which companies has been affected. About 30 companies were affected

### Notes on Additional resources

You can preview instead of committing changes

MD cheat sheets are valuable and needs to be utilize more

-A computer is a thinking machine that involves: Input, Storage, Process, Output

-Early computers were huge and started out as calculators

-As technology advances, computers have become smaller and do a lot more than just calculating numbers

-Input is what you tell computer to do. It could be using a mouse, talking into a mic, touching a screen, etc. 

-Inputs are stored in memory

-CPU uses stored memory to process information into output

-Outputs are dependent on what a computer is design to do. It could be how something is display or playing video games
