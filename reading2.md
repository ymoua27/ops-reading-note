# **How to build a computer?**

Learning how to build a computer is important, because it tells you what componets you need in order to have a working computer. NOt only that, but it allows you to upgrade parts in case you want something faster or need more storage. It also allows you to not waste money and buy expensive parts, if you don't need them for what you are doing. 

**Questions?**

**Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?**

It depends on what you want from your computer. If you do one thing only, maybe higher speed is more important. If you do a lot of diffeerent things, higher cores will allow a smoother transition. A CPU needs around 6 cores. 

**What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?**

Check the socket of the CPU and motherboard that includes:

1. Onboard Wi-Fi (ensures that your computer will have wireless capabilities)
2. Bluetooth
3. Multiple RAM slots/high RAM capacity
4. Support for graphics cards if necessary (PCIe x16 slot)

**What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?**

SDD are smaller and faster, but higher cost. Also has no moving parts. 

**Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?**

I would explain that the CPU is like the ECU of a car controlling important fuctions. The frame of the car would be the case. The power supply would be the battery, although not directly similar in how they work in their respective parts. I would tell them how a graphics card processes images to be display on a monitor and new cars even have GPUs in the infotainment systems. The computer has cooling just like a cars engine coolant.  

## Notes

Consider what you want your computer to do and budget for parts

Know components of a computer

1. CPU
2. Motherboard
3. RAM
4. Storage Drive
5. Power Supply
6. Case
7. Graphics Card
8. Cooling

Ensure components you want are compatible with each other

Assemble parts and ensure safety by grouding yourself

Once put together, power on and install OS and drivers
